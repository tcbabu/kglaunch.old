'Kglaunch' is an application launcher from 'Kulina Graphics'
(www.facebook.com/kulinagraphics , https://www.sourceforge.net/u/tcbabu).
It is basically a fun application, if you are interested in a clean
desktop, probably you may find it interesting. However, if you are a 
'GNOME' user, then 'kglaunch' may not be of much interest to you.
For others, it may have some fun. You can keep your desktop clean and
panel hidden and include 'kglaunch' in the start up programs.
If you prefer a really clean desktop, you can use, 'hotspot' (part of
kglaunch ) as your start up program instead of 'kglaunch'. It will 
provide two hotspots in the desktop;
1. In the center of the screen, a mouse click there will bring up
   'kglaunch'
2. Top left corner, which will bring up 'firefox' (if you have
   installed firefox browser).

I have personally kept 'kgclock' (https://www.sourceforge.net/u/tcbabu)
also in the start up, I like the clock on the desktop (it will alert me
my medicine time).
