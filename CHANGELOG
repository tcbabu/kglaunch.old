Ver 1.1
Compiled with 'Kulina Graphics Ver 1.3'. Also some quality improvement.
Fixed a bug with missing Icon, launcher will not crash.

Ver 1.0
A mistake was there in the default configuration file, which
was refering to  '/usr/share/icons/red_light.png' (which was
available in my system, but may not be there in other systems).
This is fixed. Also demonised 'kglaunch' (which was suppressed
for debuging).

Enabled bottom right corner as 'LOGOUT' for 'Hotspot'
